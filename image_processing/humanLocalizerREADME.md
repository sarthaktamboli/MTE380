This is for the humanLocalizer, not the objectDetector.  
humanLocalizer uses tensorflow, and is somehow slower, so it is not used.  
It is still kept in the repo for documentation purposes.  

Clone including submodule (we need the tensorflow object detection API, which is contained in the tensorflow/models repo):  
`git submodule update --init --recursive`  
  
Get the images:  
`git lfs install` (just need to run this once)  
`git lfs pull`  
  
Install tensorflow:  
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#virtual-environment-install  
  
Enable GPU support:  
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu  
  
Protobuf Installation/Compilation:  
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases  
(protoc-3.14.0-win64.zip)  
  
`cd models\research`  
`for /f %i in ('dir /b object_detection\protos\*.proto') do protoc object_detection\protos\%i --python_out=.`  
  
COCO API installation:  
(could do it in the virtual environment)  
`pip install cython`  
`pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`  
  
Install the Object Detection API  
(could do it in the virtual environment)  
`cd models\research`  
`copy object_detection\packages\tf2\setup.py .`  
`pip install --use-feature=2020-resolver .`  
  
Test installation:  
`cd models\research`  
`python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py`
